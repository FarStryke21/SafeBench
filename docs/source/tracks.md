# Challenge Tracks

In the challenge, we prepare 4 tracks covering the safety and security of both perception and control modules in autonomous driving. 
Two of the tracks aims to develop robust agents to deal with potential safety and security problems in scenarios. 
The other two tracks focus on designing scenarios that can attack agents.
The detailed description of these tracks are introduced below.

## Track 1 (Perception Defense)

### Mission
We focus on the object detection task for front view images. There are many powerful off-the-shelf models but they may not be strong enough to defense attacks happen traffic scenarios, e.g., a mask on stop sign.

In this track, the participants are required to design a robust object detection model. This model will be evaluated under scenarios that contains attacks on textures of stop sign and surrounding vehicle.

### Metric
The metric we evaluate is the IoU and accuracy of the detection results.

## Track 2 (Perception Attack)

### Mission
