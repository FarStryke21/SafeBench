# How to Create Your Own Scenario


## Step1: Define Scenario Class
All the scenario class need to inherit BasicScenarioDynamic base class defined in  pkgs/scenario_runner/srunner/scenario_dynamic/basic_scenario_dynamic.py

## Step2: Implement Functions
There are mainly two functions need to implement
1. initialize_actors(): initialize and spawn all actors
2. update_behavior(): used for manager to update each actorâ€™s behavior in each timestamp
